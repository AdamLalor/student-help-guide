# Student Help Guide.

This repo contains the source code for a website containing useful content for interns at Red Hat.

This is the github repo for building the site. To view the site go to http://feedhenry.org/student-help-guide/


## How to add to this guide

### Step 1 - Have some content

If you have some content that you think would be useful we would love to include it in this guide.

### Step 2 - Decide on how the content fits into the layout of the site.

The format of the guide is as follows:

* Top level index.html contains links to programmes.
* Programmes contain topics
* Topics contain talks/labs which can come in a pdf format (i.e. a document or a presentation).

Decide how you can fit your content into this layout. Simples! :D

See the image below for how these fit together and are linked between. Note: it is not required that your content has four topics and four talks/labs. This is only for illustrative purposes on how a page is laid out.

Coming soon - a templator to build out the required pages.
